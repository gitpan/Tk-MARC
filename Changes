Revision history for Tk::MARC.

    - moved the confusing lib/Tk-MARC.pm to lib/Tk/MARC.pm
    - had the documentation-only MARC.pm 'use Tk::MARC::Record',
      so users can just say 'use Tk::MARC' rather than
      'use Tk::MARC::Record'

      pl/muse.pl - the MARC un-optimized sample editor

    - renamed Tk::MARC::indicators to Tk::MARC::Indicators
    - renamed Tk::MARC::leader     to Tk::MARC::Leader

1.0 January 16, 2004
